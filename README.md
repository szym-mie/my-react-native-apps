# My React Native Apps 

## DISCLAIMER

These apps have been created a long time ago (2021) - the projects are full
of vulnerablilties and might not work at all, due to incompatible libraries.

## List of submodules

- `calc` - A very basic calculator
- `geo` - App showing your current location on a map
- `camera` - Camera app with preview, camera switching and gallery
- `sqlite` - Alarm clock with persistence by SQLite store
- `users` - An updateable list of users, fetched from a server
- `users-serv` - Backend for `users`
- `store` - ? (app currently missing)

## Source

All of these apps can be found on my old GitLab account as my personal projects.
